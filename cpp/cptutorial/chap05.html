<H1>Chapter 5 Making Decisions and Looping
</H1>
</A>

<BR>
<P>Choosing between different courses of action makes a program much 
more useful and flexible.  Decision making constructs allow for 
many different logical branches of code to be incorporated into a 
single program. 
<BR>
<P>One of the fundamental properties of a programming language is 
the ability to repetitively execute a sequence of statements.  
These looping capabilities enable programmers to develop concise 
programs containing repetitive processes that could otherwise 
require an excessive number of statements. 
<BR>
<H3>5.1 Program Control</H3>
<BR>
<P>The <B>if-else</B> statement allows conditional execution of a group of 
statements.  The general form of an <B>if-else</B> statement is
<BR>
<H4>
Fig 5-1
</H4>
<BR>
<PRE>
    if(expression)
    {
         statement-block-1;
    }
    else
    {
         statement-block-2;
    }
</PRE>
<BR>     
<P>where <B>expression</B> can be a combination of logical and relational 
operators and their operands, a function call, or a mathematical 
expression.  If the <B>expression</B> is true, then statement-block-1 is 
executed otherwise statement-block-2 is executed.  Only 
<B>expressions</B> evaluating to zero(0) are considered to be false in 
C and C++. 
<BR>
<P>Statements subordinate to <B>if</B> and <B>else</B> clauses can be compound 
statements; meaning several statements grouped together and 
bounded by opening and closing curly braces.  It is recommended 
that subordinate statements be indented to indicate the 
subordination.  Most programmers indent from three to five 
spaces, some use as many as eight spaces.  It is also recommended 
that code not be placed after column seventy-two (72), this makes 
all the code on a line visible on the display and usually makes 
for a readable printout. 
<BR>
<H4>
Fig 5-2
</H4>
<BR>
<PRE>
A:
    if(x == y) 
         a = b + c;

B:
    if(c >= 10)
    {
         cout << "\nC is over 10";
         ++a;
    }
    else
    {
         cout << "\nNot yet!";
         c++;
    }
</PRE>
<BR>
<P>Notice that the first example, A, does not use an <B>else</B> clause.  The 
<B>else</B> clause is optional and is only used if needed.  Also, note 
that curly braces are not used on example A because there is 
only a single statement subordinate to the <B>if</B>.
<BR>
<P><B>if-else</B> statements can be nested.  There is no reasonable limit 
imposed by the compiler to the number of nested <B>if-else</B> 
statements, although there should be a practical limit.  It is 
recommended that if nested <B>if-else</B> statements are used, that the 
nest not go over four deep.  This limit is more a matter of 
readability and not anything imposed by the compiler. 
<BR>
<P>For example, the following shows nested <B>if-else</B> statements.  
Notice how quickly the code progresses toward the right edge of 
the display, even with short variable names.  Also, this example 
has a major error in logic.  See if you can find it.
<BR>
<H4>
Fig 5-3
</H4>
<BR>
<PRE>
    if( a > 10 )
         if( b < 5 )
              b = a * 10;
    else
         if( a < 5 )
              if ( b > 10 )
                   b = a * b;
              else
                   if( c > 5 && b == 10 )
                        if( c < 10 )
                             c = b * a;
                        else
                             c = a * c;
</PRE>
<BR><BR>
<P>In nested <B>if-else</B> statements, the <B>else</B> is associated with the 
nearest <B>if</B>, unless bracketed within curly braces which form a 
compound statement.  The error in the above sample is at the very 
beginning where 
<BR>
<H4>
Fig 5-4
</H4>
<BR>
<PRE>
    if( a > 10 )
         if( b < 5 )
              b = a * 10;
    else
</PRE>
<BR>
<P>The <B>else</B> is associated by the compiler with the <B>if( b < 5 )</B>
statement not with <B>if( a > 10 )</B>.  The intention of the programmer 
was to associate the <B>else</B> with <B>if( a > 10 )</B>.  In order to 
accomplish the correct association, the code block should appear 
as
<BR>
<H4>
Fig 5-5
</H4>
<PRE>
    if( a > 10 )
    {
         if( b < 5 )
              b = a * 10;
    }
    else
</PRE>    
<P>Notice the use of the curly braces to limit the scope of the 
<B>if( b < 5 )</B> statement.  Many errors in logic occur because of 
incorrect <B>else</B> statement association.  Use the curly braces if 
there is any doubt about how the compiler will associate <B>if</B> with 
<B>else</B> statements.
<H3>
5.2 Switch Statement
</H3>
<BR>
<P>The <B>switch</B> allows the conditional execution of one of a number of 
groups of statements based on the value of an expression.  The 
general form of a <B>switch</B> statement is: 
<BR>
<H4>
Fig 5-6
</H4>
<PRE>
    switch( expression )
    {
         case constant-value-1:
              statement-block-1;
              break;

         case constant-value-2:
              statement-block-2;
              break;
         .
         .
         .
         default:
              statement-block-n;
              break;
    }
</PRE>
<BR>
<P>Where <B>expression</B> must produce an integer or character result and 
each of the constant values must be an integer or character value 
that could be a possible value of the <B>expression</B>. 
<BR>
<P>The <B>expression</B> in the switch statement is evaluated and compared 
to each of the case constant values in order.  If a match is 
found, execution is started at that <B>case</B> statement.  If no match 
is found, control is transferred to the <B>default</B> statement, if one 
has been coded. 
<BR>
<H4>
Listing 5-1
</H4>
<PRE>
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
ing main()
{
int day;
    
    cout << "\nEnter a number for"
         << "the day of the week:";
    cin >> day;

    switch( day )
    {
         case 0:
              cout << "Sunday";
              break;
         case 1:
              cout << "Monday");
              break;
         case 2:
              cout << "Tuesday";
              break;
         case 3:
              cout << "Wednesday";
              break;
         case 4:
              cout << "Thursday";
              break;
         case 5:
              cout << "Friday";
              break;
         case 6:
              cout << "Saturday";
              break;
         default:
              cout << "No Such Day";
              break;
    }
    return 0;
}
</PRE>
<BR>
<P>The <B>break</B> statement causes an immediate exit from the switch.  
Without the <B>break</B>, the execution will fall thru to the next <B>case</B> 
and will continue to fall thru until a <B>break</B> statement is 
reached.  Sometimes the desired logic is to have multiple <B>case</B> 
statements cause one code block to be executed.  For example, 
assume that the keyboard is being read and that when a newline 
character or a carriage return character is read a null byte is 
to placed at the end of an array of characters.
<BR>
<H4>
Listing 5-2
</H4>
<PRE>
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
int main()
{
char buffer[80];
int ch, idx = 0, lgth = sizeof( buffer) -1;
    
    cout << "\nEnter a string of characters: ";
    while ( idx < lgth && ch != '\n' && ch != '\r' )
    {
         cin >> ch;
         switch( ch )
         {
              case '\n':
              case '\r':
                   buffer[idx] = '\0';
                   break;
              case '\b':
                   --idx;
                   if( idx < 0 )
                        idx = 0;
                   putchar( '\b' );
                   putchar( ' ' );
                   putchar( '\b' );
                   break;
              default:
                   buffer[idx] = ch;
                   ++idx;
                   break;
         }
    }
    return 0;
}
</PRE>
<BR>
<H3>
5.3 while Loops
</H3>
<BR>
<P>The <B>while</B> loop allows for the repeated execution of a group of 
statements as long as a condition is true.  The condition is 
checked each time before the code is executed.  The general form
of the loop construct is: 
<BR>
<H4>
Fig 5-7
</H4>
<BR>
<PRE>
    while (expression)
    {
         statement-block;
    }
</PRE>
<BR>
<P>If <B>statement-block</B> comprises a group of statements, then the 
group must be bracketed by opening and closing curly braces.  The 
statement or group of statements inside the while loop will be 
executed until the expression is false 
<BR>
<H4>
Listing 5-3
</H4>
<BR>
<PRE>
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

int main()
{
int ch = 0;
    
    cout << "\nCharacter Set";
    while ( ch < 256 )
    {
         cout << "\nChar: " << char(ch) 
              << " Hex: " << hex << ch
              << " Oct: " << oct << ch 
              << " ASCII: " << ch ;
         ++ch;
    }
    return 0;
}
</PRE>
<H3>
5.4 for Loops
</H3>
<BR>
<P>The <B>for</B> loop is a specialized form of the <B>while</B> loop, which 
includes an initialization statement, a conditional expression 
and a third expression, referred to as the increment expression, 
which is executed at the end of the loop before control is 
transferred back to the conditional expression test at the loop 
beginning.  The general form of the for loop is: 
<BR>
<H4>
Fig 5-8
</H4>
<BR>
<PRE>
     for(init-expression; 
         conditional-expression; increment-expression)
    {
         statement-block;
    }
</PRE>
<BR>
All three expressions composing the <B>for</B> loop are optional.  The 
expressions can be any legal expression, function call, or 
mathematical statement.  The statements are executed as follows: 
<BR>
<H4>
Fig 5-9
</H4>
<BR>
<PRE>
    init-expression;

    loop:

         if conditional-expression is true
         begin
              statement-block;
              increment-expression
         end
         else
              exit the loop;

    end of loop:
</PRE>
<BR>
<P>The following example prints the character set being used on the 
current machine.  The program prints character, the ASCII value, 
the hexadecimal value and the octal value of the character. 
<BR>
<H4>
Listing 5-4
</H4>
<BR>
<PRE>
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

#define MAX_LINES   23

int main()
{
char ans;
int ch, lines, stop = 0, maxchars;
    //
    //    how many characters in current character set
    //
    cout << "\nHow many characters in the character set: ";
    cin >> maxchars;
    // 
    //  print the ASCII and  extended ASCII characters
    //
    for(ch = 0, lines = 0; ch < maxchars  && !stop; ++ch)
    {
         cout << "\nCHAR: " << char( ch )
              << " ASCII: " << ch
              << " HEX  : " << hex << ch
              << " OCT  : " << oct << ch
              ;
         if( ++lines > MAX_LINES )
         {
              cout << "\nContinue(Y/N)?";
              cin >> ans;
              if(ans == 'N' || ans == 'n')
              {
                   stop = 1;
                   break;
              }
              lines = 0;
         }
    }
    return 0;
}
</PRE>
<BR>
<H3>
5.5 do-while Loops
</H3>
<BR>
<P>This loop is like the while loop, except that the condition is 
checked after the loop is executed.  The general form is as 
follows:
<BR>
<H4>
Fig 5-10
</H4>
<BR>
<PRE>
    do 
    {
         statement-block;
    } while(expression);
</PRE>
<BR>
<P>The statement or statement-block are executed at least once, even 
if the expression is false on the first test. 
<BR>
<H4>
Listing 5-5
</H4>
<BR>
<PRE>
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
#define ESC 27

int main()
{
int ch;
              
    do 
    {
         cout << "\nPress any key:";
         cin >> ch;
         cout << "\nCHAR: " << ch << HEX: " << ch;

    } while(ch != ESC);
    return 0;
}
</PRE>
<BR>
<H3>
5.6 break Statement
</H3>
<BR>
<P>The <B>break</B> terminates execution of a loop or switch-case and 
transfers execution to the first statement following the loop or 
the switch-case.  If the <B>break</B> statement is within a loop that is 
nested within another loop, the <B>break</B> statement only exits the 
loop the holds the <B>break</B> statement, not the outer loop.
<BR>
<H3>
5.7 continue Statement
</H3>
<BR>
<P>The <B>continue</B> causes execution to pass to the end of the current 
loop.  For example:
<BR>
<H4>
Fig 5-11
</H4>
<BR>
<PRE>
    for(i=1; i < 100; i++)
    {
         if( i == 10 )
              continue;
         .
         .
         .
    }
</PRE>
<BR>
<P>when <B>i</B> is equal to <B>10</B> execution will go to the increment-
expression, <B>i++</B> and bypass any code between the <B>if</B> and the 
increment-expression.
<BR>
<H3>
5.8 Declarations within Blocks 
</H3>
<BR>
<P>C++ allows declarations within blocks after code statements.  
This allows a programmer to declare an entity closer to its first 
point of application.  For example, an index can be declared 
within a loop, as follows: 
<BR>
<PRE>
    for( int i = 0; i < 12; i++ )
</PRE>
<BR>
<H3>
5.9 Scope Qualifier Operator
</H3>
<BR>
<P>The new operator <B>::</B> is used to resolve name conflicts.  For 
example, if the automatic variable <B>vector_sum</B> is declared within 
a function and there exists a global variable <B>vector_sum</B>, the 
specifier <B>::vector_sum</B> allows the global variable to be accessed 
within the scope of the automatic variable <B>vector_sum</B>.
<BR>
<P>The reverse is not true.  It is not possible for the automatic 
variable <B>vector_sum</B> to be accessed from outside its scope.  The 
scope qualifier <B>::</B> is also used in connection with classes.
<BR>
<H4>
Listing 5-6
</H4>
<BR>
<PRE>
//  <B>::</B> scope resolution operator example

int i = 1;         // external or global i

#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

int main()
{
int i = 2;         // redeclares i locally to main

    {              // an inner block within a function
         cout << "Enter inner block" << endl;
         int n = i;     // the global i is still visible
         int i = 3;     // hides the global i which can only be 
                        // referenced by using the :: operator

         // print the local i and the global i
         cout << i << " i << ::i " << ::i << endl;
         cout << "n = " << n << endl;

    }    // end of inner block

    cout << "Enter outer block" << endl;
    //   print the current local i and the global i
    cout << i << " i <> ::i " << ::i << endl;
    return 0;
}
</PRE>
<BR>
<P>The output of this code is:
<BR>
<H4>
Fig 5-12
</H4>
<BR>
<PRE>
    Enter inner block
    3 i <> ::i 1
    n = 2
    Enter outer block
    2 i <> ::i 1
</PRE>
<BR>
<H3>
5.10 Scope of Identifiers
</H3>
<BR>
<P>Each identifier or name has a scope that indicates the region of 
the program where that identifier can be used.  C++ supports the 
notion of the following types of scope:
<OL>
<LI><B>Local:</B> Names appearing inside a block statement 
(enclosed in a pair of curly braces <B>{...}</B>) have local 
scope.  You can use these only within that block and 
only after the actual declaration.  Note that you cannot
define a function in a local scope.  (This means you 
cannot define one function inside the body of another.)
<LI><B>File:</B> Names appearing outside all blocks and class declarations have file scope.  These can be used within that file anywhere after the point where they are 
declared.
<LI><B>Class:</B> Names of data and function members of a <B>class</B> (or <B>struct</B>) have class scope.
</OL>
