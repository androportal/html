<PRE>
 T  F    1.   Standard files are always present and do not 
              need to be opened or closed.
           
 T  F    2.   The FILE pointer for standard file names can 
              always be used on the left side of an 
              assignment.

 T  F    3.   The <B>fopen()</B> function returns a NULL if 
              there is a problem opening the file.

 T  F    4.   After opening a file ther is an internal file 
              pointer which represents the position within 
              the file where the input or output is being 
              performed.

 T  F    5.   Two backslashes are needed inside strings (to 
              represent one backslash) because one 
              backslash merely indicates that the following 
              character is to be taken literally.
           
 T  F    6.   The <B>ftell()</B> function serves double 
              duty, both positioning and reporting position 
              within a file.
           
 T  F    7.   The ANSI standard defines only three standard 
              file handles: input, output, and error.
           
 T  F    8.   The <B>extern</B> keyword is used to provide 
              access to variables defined in another source 
              file.

 T  F    9.   Line input and record input are the same 
              thing in C.

 T  F    10.  In binary files any carriage returns that 
              appear before a line feed are dropped.
            
 T  F    11.  The internal file pointer can be positioned 
              relative to the first, end or current 
              location in the file.

 T  F    12.  <B>SEEK_SET</B> is a value passed to the 
              <B>ftell()</B> function.
            
 T  F    13.  When reading binary files no changes are 
              automatically made to the characters that are 
              read.

 T  F    14.  The function <B>fopen()</B> returns a NULL if 
              the requested file cannot be opened.

 T  F    15.  Line input is not convenient since the input 
              lines can be split across two buffers.

 T  F    16.  If a binary file is read as a text file, an 
              integer may appear as a carriage return-line 
              feed sequence.

 T  F    17.  The <B>sizeof</B> operator should be used 
              when reading data to fill a structure.

18. Match the following:

____     int &x;                  A.   open fails if the file 
                                       does not exist

____     virtual void xyz()=0;    B.   open a data stream not 
                                       attached to any file

____     class B : public A       C.   opens and moves to end
                                       of file
                                                                              
____     ~XYZ() {}                D.   pure virtural function
                                       
____     operator+(Str x, Str y); E.   opens the file for read 
                                       only

____     class B : A              F.   open fails if the file
                                       does exist
                                                                              
____     fstream fd;              G.   class destructor

____     protected                H.   a reference variable

____     ios::in                  I.   derived class to access
                                       all sections of base class
                                       as private members

____     ios::ate                 J.   derived class to access
                                       all sections of base class
                                       as public members

____     ios::noreplace           K.   operator overloading

____     ios::nocreate            L.   allows derived classes to
                                       access its members but 
                                       works as private to all 
                                       others
