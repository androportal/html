Chapter 5: Programming Exercises
</H1>
</A>
 1. Write a program to print the first 100 prime numbers.  
    A prime number any number that can be divided by itself 
    and by 1.  Use <B>cin</B> and <B>cout</B>.

 2. Write a program to produce the first 100 Fibonacci 
    numbers. A Fibonacci number is one that is the product 
    of the prior two generated numbers.  The sequence is 
    seeded with the values of 0 and 1, so that the sequence 
    starts off as

         0 1 1 2 3 ...

    Fibonacci numbers are used in computing hash table 
    locations for file management systems.  Use <B>cin</B> 
    and <B>cout</B>

 3. The factorial of an integer <B>n</B>, written 
    <B>n!</B>, is the product of the consecutive integers 1 
    through <B>n</B>.  For example, 5 factorial is 
    calculated as 

    5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

    Write a program to generate and print a table of the 
    first 10 factorials.

 4. Produce a table showing values of x, the square of x 
    and the cube of x for values of x from 1 to 50.
