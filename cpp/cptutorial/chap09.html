Chapter 9 Structures, Unions and Enumerated Types
</H1>
</A>

The C and C++ language allows for the composition of new data 
types.  It is essential that the student learn to compose new 
data types for describing abstract data structures.  This module 
shows the student how to compose and use these new data types. 

<H3>9.1 Structures</H3>

A structure allows for the storage, in contiguous areas of 
memory, of associated data items.  A structure is a template for 
a new data type whose format is defined by the programmer.  A 
structure is one of a group of language constructs that allow the 
programmer to compose his/her own data types.  The general form 
of a structure template is: 

<H3>Fig. 9-1</H3>
<PRE>
    struct [tag] 
    {
         members;
    }[variable];
</PRE>
Where <B>tag</B> is optional and only needs to be present if no <B>variable</B>
is present.  The <B>members</B> are variables declared as any C
supported data type or composed data type.  

A structure is a set of values that can be referenced 
collectively through a variable name.  The components of a 
structure are referred to as members of a structure.  A structure 
differs from an array in that members can be of different data 
types.  A structure is defined by creating a template.  A 
structure template does not occupy any memory space and does not 
have an address, it is simply a description of a new data type.  
The name of the structure is the <B>tag</B>.  The <B>tag</B> is optional when a
<B>variable</B> is present and the <B>variable</B> is optional when the <B>tag</B> is
present.  Each member-declaration has the form 
<PRE>
    data-type member-declaration. 
</PRE>
<H3>9.2 Declaring structure variables</H3>

Storage is allocated for the structure when a variable of that 
structure type is declared.   The following is an example of a 
structure template.

<H4>Fig. 9-2</H4>
<PRE>
    /* define template */
    struct Person
    {
         char ssn[12]
              ,last_name[20]
              ,first_name[16]
              ,street[20]
              ,city[20]
              ,state[3]
              ,zip_code[11]
              ;
         int age;
         float height
              ,weight
              ;
         double salary;
    };                   
</PRE>
In the C language, a variable of the above data type would be 
declared as follows:

<H4>Fig. 9-3</H4>
<PRE>
    main()
    {
    /* declare variable of structure person type */
    struct Person frank;
         ...
    }
</PRE>
In the C++ language, the use of the keyword <B>struct</B> would not be
required in the declaration of a variable of the above type.

<H4>Fig. 9-4</H4>
<PRE>
    main()
    {
    // declare variable of structure person type 
    Person frank;
         ...
    }
</PRE>
Each member of a structure is in a contiguous memory location in 
relationship to its previous member and next member.  To access 
individual members of a structure, the dot operator is used to 
connect a variable name with an element in the structure.  For 
example 
<PRE>
    frank.last_name
</PRE>
The composed name is treated as a variable of with the type of 
the member variable. 

<H4>Fig. 9-5</H4>
<PRE>
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
    struct Person ralph;

         printf( "\nEnter your first name:" );
         gets( ralph.first_name );
              .
              .
              .
         printf( "\nEnter your age:" );
         scanf( "%d", &ralph.age );
         return 0;
    }

or in C++ 

<H4>Fig. 9-6</H4>

    #include <iostreams.h>
    int main()
    {
    Person ralph;

         cout << "\nEnter your first name:";
         cin >> ralph.first_name;
              .
              .
              .
         cout << "\nEnter your age:";
         cin >> ralph.age;
         return 0;
    }
</PRE>
<H3>9.3 Initializing Structures</H3>
         
Structures can be initialized when the template is created, if a 
variable of the structure type is declared with the template 
creation.

<H4>Fig. 9-7</H4>
<PRE>
    Person employ = {"Ralph",
                     "Jones",
                     "123 Main",
                     "Nowhere",
                     "NV",
                     "12345-9878"
                     30,
                     72,
                     165
                    };
</PRE>
<H3>9.4 Assignment of Structures</H3>

Values are assigned to individual members of the structure by 
using the structure variable name connected with the structure 
member name.
<PRE>
    employ.age = 35;
</PRE>
The <B>.</B> operator is used to provide the connection between variable
name and member name.  When referencing a particular member of a 
structure, the resulting type of that expression is that of the 
member being referenced.
<PRE>
    strcpy(employ.street,"3188 Trinity Drive");
</PRE>
The value of one structure variable can be assigned to another 
structure variable of the same type. 
<PRE>
    Person employ, employ2;

         employ = employ2;
</PRE>
The above assignment is a valid statement.  The data stored in 
<B>employ2</B> would be stored in <B>employ</B>, because objects of like type
can be assigned to one another.  

Structure variables cannot be compared through a relational 
operator.  The following example attempts to compare two 
structure variables of the same type.

<H4>Fig. 9-8</H4>
<PRE>
    int main()
    {
    Person employee, staff;
         employee = staff;
         if( employee == staff )
               ...
</PRE>
The above code is invalid, each member of the structure must be 
compared in order to establish equality or non-equality.  

<H3>9.5 Nested Structures</H3>

A structure variable can be a member of another structure 
template.

<H4>Fig. 9-9</H4>
<PRE>
    struct Vital
    {
         int age
              ,height
              ,weight
              ;
    };
 
    struct Home
    {
         char f_name[12]
             ,l_name[20]
             ,street[20]
             ,city[20]
             ,state[3]
             ,zip_code[11]
             ;
    };

    struct Person
    {
         Vital emp;
         Home place;
    } employ;
</PRE>
In order to access a member of one of the nested structures, the 
dot operator is used until the lowest member is reached in the 
structure hierarchy.

<H4>Fig. 9-10</H4>
<PRE>
    cout << "Enter your age: ";
    cin >> employ.emp.age;

    cout << "Enter your last name: ";
    cin >> employ.place.lname;
</PRE>
<H3>9.6 Arrays of Structures</H3>

Like any other data type in C, a variable of a structure type can 
be arrayed.

<H4>Fig. 9-11</H4>
<PRE>
    struct Person
    {
         Vital emp;
         Home place;
    } stats[100];
</PRE>
The above declaration would allow for the storage of 100 items of 
type <B>people</B>.  Any specific item could be referenced as:
<PRE>
    stats[indx].place.f_name

    stats[indx].emp.age
</PRE>
Notice <B>stats</B> is the arrayed item, and requires the array
operator, <B>[]</B>.

<H3>9.7 Passing Structures to Functions</H3>

Structures can be passed as an argument to a function simply by 
writing the variable name in the argument list when calling the 
function.

<H4>Fig. 9-12</H4>
<PRE>
    main()
    {
    void getData( Person );  // function prototype 
    Person employee;         

         getData(employee);
              .
              .
              .
    }
    void getData( Person x )
    {
         cout << "Enter last name: ";
         cin >> x.l_name;
         .
         .
         .
    }
</PRE>
Just like any other argument, a structure is passed by value; 
therefore, functions may not make permanent changes to the values 
of members of the structure.  

A structure may be used as the return-type of a function. 

<H4>Fig 9-13</H4>
<PRE>
    Person getData( Person newemp )
    {
                   ...
         return( newemp );
    }
</PRE>
The calling routine can store the structure data returned into a 
like typed structure variable.

<H4>Fig 9-14</H4>
<PRE>
    int main()
    {
    void getData( Person );
    Person newemp, employee;
         newemp = getData(employee);
              ...
    }
</PRE>
If the function being called is to modify or change the data 
within the structure, the address of the structure variable can 
be passed and the called function can work with the structure 
members through a pointer.  This method is referred to as call by 
reference.

<H4>Fig. 9-15</H4>
<PRE>
    #include <stdio.h>

    main()
    {
    void getData( Person * );
    Person employ;

         getData( &employ );

    }

    void getData( Person *ptr )
    {
         cout << "Enter first name:";
         cin >> ptr->place.f_name;
         cout << "\nEnter last name:";
         cin >> ptr->place.l_name;
                   .
                   .
                   .
         cout << "\nEnter age:";
         cin >> ptr->person.age;
    }
</PRE>
Notice that the <B>-></B> operator is used when referencing a pointer to
a structure.  Functions can also return pointers to structures.

<H3>9.8 Unions</H3>

A union is an aggregate variable that can declare several data 
types, but only store the value of one variable at any one time; 
each data type shares the same area of memory. 

The declaration of a union is similar to that of a 
structure:

<H4>Fig. 9-16</H4>
<PRE>
    union [union_tag]
    {
         data_type variable_1;
         data_type variable_2;
         data_type variable_3;
         .
         .
         .
    } {union_variable_name};
</PRE>
As with a structure, a <B>union_tag</B> is optional if a
<B>union_variable_name</B> is present.  The compiler allocates only the
storage space of the largest data_type declared.

<H4>Fig. 9-17</H4>
<PRE>
    union Data
    {
         char str[6];
         int y;
         long z;
         float x;
         double t;
    } var;
</PRE>
The union variable <B>var</B> is given eight(8) bytes of storage; all
the elements start at the same address in memory; the compiler 
gives the amount of storage needed by the largest data type, in 
this case <B>double</B> which is eight bytes.

<H3>9.9 Accessing Members of a union</H3>

To access a member of a union the dot operator is used the same 
as with structures.
<PRE>
    var.x = 123.45;
</PRE>
Unions passed to functions exactly as a structure would be 
passed.

<H3>9.10 Anonymous unions in C++</H3>

Unions without a name can be defined anywhere a variable or field 
can be defined.  They allow sharing of memory storage among two 
or more fields of the structure for economy of memory storage.

<H4>Fig. 9-18</H4>
<PRE>
    struct data-rec
    {
         char *last_name;
         char *first_name;
         int id_number;
         union
         {
              float annual_salary;
              float hourly_wage;
         };
    };
</PRE>
All members of a union require only as much memory storage as the 
largest member.  For the structure given above, storage for only 
one floating point entity is required.  The union members 
<B>annual_salary</B> and <B>hourly_wage</B> are stored at the same memory
address.  Each instance of a <B>data_rec</B> can only store one of these
members.

One can access a member of an anonymous union as in the 
following:
<PRE>
    data_rec  my_record;
         cout << "My annual salary = "
              << my_record.annual_salary 
              << endl;
</PRE>
<H3>9.11 Bit Fields</H3>

With the use of <B>unions</B> and <B>structures</B> C can access individual
bits of a word or byte.  Bit fields are required to be unsigned 
integers.  Bit fields are allowed to be declared in a structure that 
includes other data types.  When mapping a area of memory to the 
bit level, it must be understood that hardware engineers number 
bits differently than software engineers.  For example, assume 
that there is a one byte area of memory that is to be mapped to 
the bit level, a hardware engineer would describe the one byte 
area as follows:

<H4>Fig. 9-19</H4>
<PRE>
bit:  0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
</PRE>
but a software engineer would describe the area of memory as 
follows:

<H4>Fig. 9-20</H4>
<PRE>
bit:  7    6    5    4    3    2    1    0
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
</PRE>
As the programmer can see, a reference to bit number 2 would mean 
one thing to a hardware person and an entirely different thing to 
a software person.  Most specifications for hardware are produced 
by hardware engineers and the software to use that hardware is 
written by software people, so over the years an understanding 
has been reached.  

As an additional complication, the Intel family of processors 
used in IBM type personal computers, uses a different arrangement 
for words of memory than any other processor.  With most 
computers a word of memory has a <B>most significant byte (MSB)</B> and
a <B>least significant byte (LSB)</B>.  On most processors a word of
memory would look as follows:

<H4>Fig. 9-21</H4>
<PRE>
    |    Byte 1             |     Byte 0            |
    |15 14 13 12 11 10 9  8 |7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0 |  
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |    MSB                |     LSB               |
</PRE>    
But with the Intel processor, which uses something called "Big-Endian" and "Little-Endian" notation, the above word of storage will look as follows:

<H4>Fig. 9-22</H4>
<PRE>
    |    Byte 0             |     Byte 1            |
    |7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0 |7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0 |  
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |    LSB                |     MSB               |
</PRE>
For an illustration, there is a word in memory on all MS-DOS 
machines that is used to hold the status of keyboard toggles, 
such as <B>Caps Lock</B>, <B>Insert</B>, and others.  The following example
shows a union that is used to determine the status of those 
keyboard toggles. 

<H4>Fig. 9-23</H4>
<PRE>
    #include <stdio.h>
    // address of segment and offset of 
    // keyboard control bits, byte address
    // 0017 and 0018 on IBM PC running MS-DOS

    #define BASE_ADDR   0x00400017 
    // layout of 16 bits of memory 
    union KeyBits 
    {        
         unsigned keys;      // everything together 
                       
         // Pg. 223, Peter Norton's 
         // "Inside the IBM PC".  
         // Must reverse order of bits in each byte 

         struct Bits 
         {
              // byte 0 
              unsigned right_shift    :1; // bit 7 
              unsigned left_shift     :1; // bit 6 
              unsigned ctrl_pressed   :1; // bit 5 
              unsigned alt_pressed    :1; // bit 4 
              unsigned scroll_lock    :1; // bit 3 
              unsigned num_lock       :1; // bit 2 
              unsigned caps_lock      :1; // bit 1 
              unsigned ins            :1; // bit 0 
              // byte 1 
              unsigned                :1; // bit 7 
              unsigned                :1; // bit 6 
              unsigned pcjr_click     :1; // bit 5 
              unsigned hold_state     :1; // bit 4 
              unsigned scr_pressed    :1; // bit 3 
              unsigned num_pressed    :1; // bit 2 
              unsigned caps_pressed   :1; // bit 1 
              unsigned ins_pressed    :1; // bit 0 
         } format; // structure variable 
    }; 

    void keyCtrl()
    {
    // use a long far pointer; 'far' 
    // allows a pointer to hold 
    // a 32-bit address, instead of 
    // normal or 'near' of 16-bits
    // this allows you to go indirectly 
    // and get value at address
    unsigned far *p;
    KeyBits keyWord;
         // 
         // initialize bits to off position
         //
         keyWord.keys = 0;
         //
         // establish pointer to absolute address
         //             
         p = (unsigned far *)BASE_ADDR;
         //
         // retrieve bit settings 
         //
         keyWord.keys = *p;
         // 
         // print those toggles that are on
         //
         cout << (keyWord.format.ins
                   ?"Ins ":"" )
              << (keyWord.format.caps_lock
                   ?"Caps Lock ":"")
              << (keyWord.format.num_lock
                   ?"Num Lock ":"" )
              << (keyWord.format.scroll_lock
                   ?"Scroll Lock ":"")
              << (keyWord.format.alt_pressed
                   ?"Alt Pressed":"")
              << (keyWord.format.ctrl_pressed
                   ?"Ctrl Pressed":"")
              << (keyWord.format.left_shift
                   ?"Left Shift Pressed":"")
              << (keyWord.format.right_shift
                   ?"Right Shift Pressed":"")
              << (keyWord.format.ins_pressed
                   ?"Insert":"")
              << (keyWord.format.caps_pressed
                   ?"Caps":"")
              << (keyWord.format.num_pressed
                   ?"NumLck":"")
              << (keyWord.format.scr_pressed
                   ?"ScrollLck":"")
              ;
    }// end of keyCtrl()
</PRE>
Notice that for bit positions that have no meaning there is no 
element name, but there must be a length of the number of bits to 
skip. 

<H3>9.12 Byte Alignment</H3>

Bit field with a length of zero (0) causes the next bit to be 
aligned at the next byte in memory.  A bit mapping cannot map 
more than one word of memory.  The length of a word will depend 
upon the machine the program is running upon.

<H4>Fig. 9-24</H4>

    struct Data
    {
         unsigned a     :1;
         unsigned b     :3;
         unsigned x     :0;
         unsigned y     :1;
         unsigned z     :2;
    } bitfields;
</PRE>
<B>bitfields.x</B> causes the next bit field, <B>bitfields.y</B> to be
positioned at the start of the next byte in memory.

<H3>9.13 Enumerated Data Types</H3>

Enumerated types provide the facility to specify the possible 
values of a variable by meaningful symbolic names.  The general 
format for defining an enumerated type is
<PRE>
    enum tag { value1, value2, ..., valueN };
</PRE>
where tag is an identifier that names the enumerated type, and 
value1, value2, ..., valueN are identifiers, called enumerated
constants.  For example, the declaration
<PRE>
    enum Days { Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, 
              Friday, Saturday };
</PRE>
defines an enumerated type <B>Days</B> whose list of possible values are
<B>Sunday</B>, <B>Monday</B>, <B>Tuesday</B>, <B>Wednesday</B>, <B>Thursday</B>, <B>Friday</B>, and 
<B>Saturday</B>.

Each of the values in the enumerated type has an ordinal value 
associated with it.  The default values start at <B>0</B> and proceed in
increments of <B>1</B> until all values in the list have an ordinal
value.  In the list of values for <B>Days</B>, the default ordinal
values are <B>Sunday</B> has <B>0</B>, <B>Monday</B> has <B>1</B>, <B>Tuesday</B> has <B>2</B>, <B>Wednesday</B>
has <B>3</B>, <B>Thursday</B> has <B>4</B>, <B>Friday</B> has <B>5</B>, and <B>Saturday</B> has <B>6</B>.  An
integer value may explicitly be associated with an enumeration 
constant by following it with <B>=</B> and a constant expression of
integral type.  Subsequent enumeration constants without explicit 
associations are assigned integer values one greater than the 
value associated with the previous enumerated constant.  For 
example, the declaration
<PRE>
    enum Days { Sunday=6, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday=2, 
              Thursday, Friday, Saturday};
</PRE>
results in the value <B>6</B> being associated with <B>Sunday</B>, <B>7</B> with
<B>Monday</B>, <B>8</B> with <B>Tuesday</B>, <B>2</B> with <B>Wednesday</B>, <B>3</B> with <B>Thursday</B>, <B>4</B> with
<B>Friday</B>, and <B>5</B> with <B>Saturday</B>.

Any signed integer value may be associated with an enumeration 
constant.  The same integer value may be associated with two 
different enumerated constants in the same type declaration. 

An enumerated constant must be unique with respect to other 
enumerated constants and variables within the same name scope.  
Thus, in the presence of the declaration of <B>days</B>, the declaration
<PRE>
    enum DaysOff { Saturday, Sunday };
</PRE>
is illegal because the identifiers <B>Saturday</B> and <B>Sunday</B> have
already been defined to be enumerated constant values of <B>days</B>.
Similarly, the variable declaration 
<PRE>
    float Monday;
</PRE>
following the declaration of <B>Days</B>, is also illegal.

Variables may be declared to be of an enumerated type in the 
same declaration containing the enumerated type definition, or 
in subsequent declarations of the form 
<PRE>
    enum tag variablelist;
</PRE>
Thus, <B>weekday</B> and <B>caldays</B> may be declared to be of type <B>enum days</B>
<PRE>
    enum Days { Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, 
              Friday, Saturday }  weekday, caldays;

or

    enum Days weekday, caldays;
</PRE>
The tag may be omitted from the declaration of an enumerated
type if all the variables of this type have been declared at the 
same time. Thus, the programmer may write
<PRE>
    enum  { Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, 
              Friday, Saturday }  weekday, caldays;
</PRE>
but due to the omission of the enumerated tag, the programmer may 
not subsequently declare another variable whose type is the same 
as that of <B>weekday</B> or <B>caldays</B>.

A variable of a particular enumerated type can be assigned 
enumerated constants specified in the definition of the 
enumeration type.  For example, the programmer may write
<PRE>
    weekday = Tuesday;
</PRE>
The programmer may also compare values as in 
<PRE>
    if( weekday == caldays )
</PRE>
All enumerated types are treated as integer types, and the type 
of enumerated constants is treated as <B>int</B>.  However, the
programmer should differentiate between enumerated and integer 
types as a matter of good programming practice and use casts if 
they have to be mixed, as show in the following example: 
<PRE>
    typedef
    enum  { Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, 
              Friday, Saturday } DAYS;

    DAYS nextday( DAYS this )
    {
         return( DAYS )( (int)this +1) % 7);
    }

<H3>9.14 Enumerated Types in C++</H3>

The name of an enumeration is a type name.  It is not necessary 
in C++ to use the qualifier <B>enum</B> in front of the enumerated type
name and as a result this streamlines the notation.

In ANSI C, the list of constants appearing in an <B>enum</B> are known
throughout the file.  C++ considers the constants in an <B>enum</B> to
be local to a class or a struct and known only to member and 
friend functions of the class.  

<H4>Fig. 9-25</H4>
<PRE>
    struct SWindow
    {
         enum Operation {refresh, remove, clear, scroll};
         void execute( Operation op);
         .
         .
         .
    };

    struct SDocument
    {
         enum Document {brochure, pamphlet, report, book };
         void setDocument( Document type );
         .
         .
         .
    };

    int main()
    {
         SWindow win;
         win.execute( SWindow::scroll );

         SDocument doc;
         doc.setDocument( SDocument::scroll );
         .
         .
         .
    }
</PRE>
<P>
Notice the use of the <B>::</B> operator, the scope resolution operator.
This operator associates the structure with the enumerated value 
defined within that structure.  Although <B>scroll</B> is defined as a
value in two enumerated types in two different structures by 
using the scope resolution operator there is no difficulty for 
the compiler in determinining which <B>scroll</B> is being referred in
each instance.

<H3>9.15 Structures as Abstract Data Types</H3>

The concept of <B>struct</B> is augmented in C++ to allow functions to
be members.  The function declaration is included in the 
structure declaration and is invoked by using access methods for 
structure members.  The idea is that the functionality required 
by the <B>struct</B> data type should be directly included in the <B>struct</B>
declaration.  This improves the encapsulation of the Abstract 
Data Type (ADT) by packaging its operations together with its 
data representation.  In traditional OOP terminology, a member 
function is a method. 

The following is an example of implementing a stack as an 
Abstract Data Type (ADT) using a <B>struct</B>

<H4>Listing 9-2:</H4>
<PRE>
//
//  stack.cpp - implementation with constructor and destructor
//
#include <iostream.h>

enum BOOLEAN {FALSE, TRUE};

const int MAXSTACK = 100;

struct Stack
{
private:
    char *s;
    int max_len;
    int top;
    enum { EMPTY = 0, FULL = MAXSTACK -1 };
public:
    Stack()
    {
         max_len = MAXSTACK;
         s = new char[max_len];
         top = EMPTY;
    }
    Stack( int size )
    {
         s = new char[size];
         max_len = size;
         top = EMPTY;
    }
    ~Stack()
    {
         delete s;
    }
    void reset( void )
    {
         top = EMPTY;
    }
    void push( char c )
    {
         top++;
         s[top] = c;
    }
    char pop( void )
    {
         return (s[top--]);
    }
    char top_of( void )
    {
         return (s[top]);
    }
    BOOLEAN empty( void )
    {
         return ((top == EMPTY) ? TRUE : FALSE );
    }
    BOOLEAN full( void )
    {
         return ( (top == max_len - 1) ? TRUE : FALSE );
    }
};

int main()
{
Stack z(50);
Stack t;
char *str = "My name is Don Knuth!";
char *str2 = "My dog has fleas and needs a bath.";
int i = 0;

    cout << str << endl;
    z.reset();
    //   push data on the stack
    while( str[i] )
         if( !z.full() )
              z.push( str[i++] );
    //   pop characters from the stack and print
    while( !z.empty() )
         cout << z.pop();
    cout << endl;

    cout << str2 << endl;
    i = 0;
    while( str2[i] )
         if( !t.full() )
              t.push( str2[i++] );
    while( !t.empty() )
         cout << t.pop();
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
</PRE>
The member functions are written much as other functions.  One 
difference is that they can use the data member names as they are.  
Thus the member functions in <B>Stack</B> use <B>top</B> and <B>s</B> in an unqualified
manner.  When invoked on a particular object of type <B>Stack</B>, they
act on the specified member in that object.  In OOP terminology 
an invocation is called message passing.  In these terms a stack 
object receiving the message "pop" executes the pop method.  

The following example illustrates  these ideas.  If two <B>Stack</B>
variables 
<PRE>
    Stack data, operands;
</PRE>
are declared, then 
<PRE>
    data.reset();
    operands.reset();
</PRE>
invoke the member function <B>reset</B>, which has the effect of setting
both <B>data.top</B> and <B>operands.top</B> to EMPTY.  If a pointer to <B>Stack</B>
<PRE>
    Stack *ptr_operands = &operands;
</PRE>
is declared, then 
<PRE>
    ptr_operands->push('A');
</PRE>
invokes the member function <B>push</B>, which has the effect of
incrementing <B>operands.top</B> and setting <B>operands.s[top]</B> to 'A'.

Member functions that are defined within the struct are 
implicitly inline.  As a rule only short, heavily used member 
functions should be defined within the struct.  To define a 
member function outside the struct, the scope resolution operator 
<B>::</B> is used.  To illustrate this, the definition of <B>push</B> will be
changed to a function prototype within <B>struct Stack</B>.  The
implementation of the <B>push</B> method will be defined outside the
scope of the <B>struct Stack</B> which requires using the scope
resolution operator to associate <B>push</B> with the <B>struct Stack</B>.
In this case the function is not implicitly inline. 

<H4>Fig. 9-26</H4>
<PRE>
struct Stack
{
private:
    char *s;
    int max_len;
    int top;
    enum { EMPTY = 0, FULL = MAXSTACK -1 };
public:
    Stack()
    {
         max_len = MAXSTACK;
         s = new char[max_len];
         top = EMPTY;
    }
    Stack( int size )
    {
         s = new char[size];
         max_len = size;
         top = EMPTY;
    }
    ~Stack()
    {
         delete s;
    }
    void reset( void )
    {
         top = EMPTY;
    }
    void push( char c );
    .
    .
    .
};

void Stack::push( char c )
{
    top++;
    s[top] = c;
}
</PRE>
The scope resolution operator allows member functions from the 
different struct types to have the same names.  In this case, 
which member function is invoked depends on the type of object it 
acts on.  Member functions within the same struct can be 
overloaded.  Consider adding to the data type <B>Stack</B> a pop
operation that has an integer parameter that pops the stack that 
many times before returning a value.  It could be added as the 
following function prototype within the struct:

<H4>Fig. 9-27</H4>
<PRE>
struct Stack
{
    ...
    char pop( int n );
    ...
};

char Stack::pop(int n )
{
    while( n-- > 0 )
         top--;
    return( s[top--] );
}
</PRE>
The definition that is invoked depends on the actual arguments to 
<B>pop</B>.
<PRE>
    data.pop();         // invokes standard pop
    data.pop(5);        // invokes repeated pop
</PRE>
The <B>inline</B> specification can be used explicitly with member
functions defined at file scope.  This avoids having to clutter 
the struct definition with function bodies.

<H4>Fig. 9-28</H4>
<PRE>
struct Stack
{
    ...
    void reset();
    void push( char c );
    ...
};

inline void Stack::reset()
{
    top = EMPTY;
}
inline void Stack::push( char c )
{
    s[++top} = c;
}
</PRE>
The grouping of operations with data emphasizes their 
"objectness".  Objects have a description and behavior.  The data 
members hold the description or attributes of an object and the 
member functions implement the behavior of an object. 

The concept of struct is augmented in C++ to allow functions to 
have <B>public</B>, <B>private</B>, and <B>protected</B> members.  For now the
<B>protected</B> keyword is a synonym for <B>private</B>.  Its real use will be
shown when the topic of class inheritance is discussed.  Inside a 
struct the use of the keyword <B>private</B> followed by a colon
restricts the access of the members that follow this construct.  
The <B>private</B> members can be used by only a few categories of
functions, whose privileges included access to these members.  
These functions include the member functions of the struct.  

In the above complete implementation of <B>Stack</B>, we can see that
the data members <B>s</B>, <B>max_len</B>, and <B>top</B> are in the <B>private</B> section
of the <B>Stack</B>.  By placing data members within a <B>private</B> section
only member functions of the <B>Stack</B> can modify the data members.
For example, <B>top</B> can be modified by the member function <B>reset</B> but
cannot be accessed directly by the <B>main()</B> function.

The <B>Stack</B> has a private part that contains its data description
and a public part that contains member functions to implement 
stack operations.  It is useful to think of the private part as 
restricted to the implementor's use and the public part as an 
interface specification that clients may use.  At a later time 
implementor could change the private part without affecting the 
correctness of a client's use of the stack type.  

Hiding data is an important component of OOP.  It allows for more 
easily debugged and maintained code because errors and 
modifications are localized.  Client programs need only be aware 
of the type's interface specification.  As a rule of thumb, data 
members should be placed in the <B>private</B> part of a structure and
accessed using member functions.  Such an accessing discipline 
ensures that a client cannot tamper with or misuse the 
implemented ADT. 

<H3>9.16 Constructors and Destructors</H3>

Note that the <B>Stack</B> structure has two member functions named
<B>Stack</B> and another named <B>~Stack</B>.  The two member functions named
<B>Stack</B> are called constructors.  The member function named <B>~Stack</B>
is called the destructor of the class.  The C++ compiler calls a 
constructor, if one is defined, whenever an instance of a struct 
or class is created.  In C terms, when an identifier of type 
<B>Stack</B> is declared a constructor is automatically called.  The
programmer can use the constructor to handle any specific 
requirements for initializing objects of a type.  For example, if 
an object needs extra storage, the programmer can allocate memory 
in the constructor.  In the <B>Stack</B> class, the constructor calls
<B>new</B> to allocate space for the storage of data on the stack.  Note
that the constructor function always has the same name as that of 
the struct or class.  Also, there are two functions with the name 
<B>Stack</B>.  The constructor has been overloaded so that there is more
than one way to initialize an instance of a <B>Stack</B>.  Which
constructor is call will depend upon how the instance variable of 
the <B>Stack</B> type is declared.  For example
<PRE>
    Stack mystack;
</PRE>
will cause the constructor function <B>Stack()</B>, which is the default
constructor, to be called.  But, with a declaration such as
<PRE>
    Stack mystack(50);
</PRE>
the constructor function <B>Stack( int size )</B> will be called.  Also,
notice that constructors do can return any values.  Constructors 
and destructors cannot return a value.  

The programmer can also define a destructor function for a struct 
or class.  There can be one and only one destructor for a struct 
or class.  A destructor is called if there is any need to clean 
up after an object is destroyed ( for example, if the programmer 
wants to free memory allocated in the constructor).  The C++ 
compiler generates code that calls the destructor function of a 
structure or class whenever an instance of that struct or class 
goes out of scope.  The destructor has the same name as the type 
except for a tilde (<B>~</B>) prefix.  Thus, the destructor function for
the struct <B>Stack</B> is <B>~Stack()</B>.  A destructor is not called unless
an explicit or implicit <B>return</B> statement is executed.  If no
explicit <B>return</B> statement is executed in a function that an
instance of a structure or class, then the implicit <B>return</B>
generated by encountering the closing curly brace of the function 
will cause the destructor to be called.  Using the <B>exit()</B>
function to terminate a program is discouraged because it exits 
the program immediately and does not allow for the class or 
structure destructors to be called.  

<H3>9.17 What Is Object-Oriented Programming?</H3>

<P>Up until now the book has addressed syntax of the C and C++ language, because until now both languages share the same syntax, except for a few minor exceptions.  Now, a major difference is to be addressed.  How a program is actually assembled from a structured oriented approach and from an object oriented approach.  The topic of what makes a program object oriented must be understood before an attempt is made to develop such an application.

<P>The term object-oriented programming (OOP) is widely used, but 
experts cannot seem to agree on its exact definition.  However, 
most experts agree that OOP involves defining abstract data types 
(ADT) that represent complex real-world or abstract objects and 
organizing the program around the collection of ADTs with an eye 
toward exploiting their common features.  The term data 
abstraction refers to the process of defining ADTs.  Object-
oriented programming also involves the use of inheritance and 
polymorphism as the mechanisms that enable the programmer to take 
advantage of the common characteristics of the ADTs - the objects 
in the OOP. 

<P>OOP is only a method of designing and implementing software.  Use 
of object-oriented techniques does not impart anything to a 
finished software product that the user can see.  However, as a 
programmer implementing the software, you can gain significant 
advantages by using object-oriented methods, especially in large 
software projects.  Because OOP enables the programmer to remain 
close to the conceptual, higher-level model of the real-world 
problem he/she is trying to solve, the programmer can manage the 
complexity better than with approaches that force the programmer 
to map the problem to fit the features of the language.  The 
programmer can take advantage of the modularity of objects and 
implement the program in relatively independent units that are 
easier to maintain and extend.  The programmer can also share 
code among objects through inheritance and take advantage of the 
commonality among objects that are inherited with polymorphism. 

OOP has nothing to do with any programming language, although a 
programming language that supports OOP makes it easier to 
implement the object-oriented techniques, the programmer can use 
objects in C programs, assembly language programs or BASIC 
programs.  OOP is more a way of conceptualizing the problem and 
of implementing the code. 

<H3>9.18 Procedure-Oriented Programming</H3>

Before the programmer gets into OOP, take a look at conventional 
procedure-oriented programming in a language such as C.  Using 
the procedure-oriented approach, the programmer views a problem 
as a sequence of things to do.  The programmer organizes the 
related data items into <B>C structs </B>and write the necessary
functions (procedures) to manipulate the data and in the process, 
complete the sequence of tasks that solve the problem.  Although 
the data may be organized into structures, the primary focus is 
on the functions.  Each C function transforms data in some way.  
For example, the programmer may have a function that prompts for 
and reads values into the members of a structure, another that 
computes the mean of a set of numbers, and one that prints the 
values held in a structure.  The programmer does not have to look 
far to find examples of this kind of programming - C function 
libraries are implemented this way.  Each function in a library 
performs a well-defined operation on its input arguments and 
returns the transformed data as a return value.  Arguments may be 
pointers to data that the function directly alters or the 
function may have the effect of displaying graphics on a video 
monitor. 

For a concrete illustration of procedure-oriented programming, 
consider the following example.  This is a classic example used 
in many C++ books for illustrating the advantages of OOP over 
structured methods.  Suppose the programmer wants to write a 
computer program that handles geometric shapes such as rectangles 
and circles.  The program should be able to draw any shape and 
compute its area.  Here is a conventional approach to writing 
this program.

<H3>9.19 Adding a New Shape</H3>

To see one of the problems of conventional procedure-oriented 
programming consider what happens when the programmer wants the 
program to handle another type of geometric shape - say, 
triangles.  
<PRE>
1.  Define a data structure for triangles.

    typedef
    enum tagSHAPE_TYPE
    {
         A_CIRCLE
         ,A_RECTANGLE
         ,A_TRIANGLE
    } SHAPE_TYPE;

    typedef struct TRIANGLE_SHAPE
    {
         SHAPE_TYPE     type;    /* type of shape (T_TRIANGLE) */
         double         x1, y1;  /* coordinates of the corners */
         double         x2, y2;
         double         x3, y3;
    }    TRIANGLE_SHAPE;

2.  Add a new member to the SHAPE union.

    typedef union SHAPE
    {
         SHAPE_TYPE          type;     /* type of shape */
         CIRCLE_SHAPE        circle;   /* data for circle */
         RECTANGLE_SHAPE     rectangle;/* data for rectangle */
         TRIANGLE_SHAPE      triangle; /* data for triangle */
    }   SHAPE;

3.  In the cshapes.c file, add code in the functions 
    <B>compute_area()</B> and <B>draw()</B> to handle triangles.

<H4>Fig. 9-29</H4>
/*
*   compute the area of the shape and return the area
*/
double compute_area ( SHAPE *pShape )
{
double area;
    /*
    *    handle each shape according to its type
    */
    switch( pShape->type )
    {
         case A_CIRCLE:
              area = PI * pShape->circle.radius
                        * pShape->circle.radius;
              break;

         case A_RECTANGLE:
              area = fabs( (pShape->rectangle.x2 
                             - pShape->rectangle.x1)
                        *  (pShape->rectangle.y2 
                             - pShape->rectangle.y1)
                        );
              break;

         case A_TRIANGLE:
         {
              double x21, y21, x31, y31;

              x21  = pShape->triangle.x2 
                        - pShape->triangle.x1;
              y21 = pShape->triangle.y2 
                        - pShape->triangle.y1;
              x31 = pShape->triangle.x3 
                        - pShape->triangle.x1;
              y31 = pShape->triangle.y3 
                        - pShape->triangle.y1;
              area = fabs ( y21 * x31 - x21 * y31 ) / 2.0;
          }
              break;

         default:
              printf("Unknown shape\n");
    }
    return area;
}
/*
*   draw a shape (print information about shape)
*/
void draw( SHAPE *pShape )
{
    /*
    *    handle each shape according to its type 
    */
    printf( "Draw: " );
    switch( pShape->type )
    {
         case A_CIRCLE:
              printf( "Circle of radius %f at (%f, %f)\n",
                   pShape->circle.radius,
                   pShape->circle.x, pShape->circle.y);
              break;

         case A_RECTANGLE:
              printf( "Rectangle with corners:"
                   "(%f, %f) at (%f, %f )\n",
                   pShape->rectangle.x1,
                   pShape->rectangle.y1,
                   pShape->rectangle.x2,
                   pShape->rectangle.y2,

              break;

         case A_TRIANGLE:
              printf( "Triangle with vertices: "
                        "(%f, %f) (%f, %f) (%f, %f)\n",
                        pShape->triangle.x1, 
                        pShape->triangle.y1
                        pShape->triangle.x2, 
                        pShape->triangle.y2
                        pShape->triangle.x3, 
                        pShape->triangle.y3 );
              break;

         default:
              printf("Unknown shape\n");
    }
}

4.  The programmer can now test operations on the triangle shape.

<H4>Fig. 9-30</H4>
/*
*   program to test shape-handling functions 
*/
int main()
{
int i;
SHAPE s[3];
    /*
    *    initialize the shapes
    *
    *    A 10 x 40 rectangle with upper left corner at 
    *    (10, 10)
    */
    s[0].type = A_RECTANGLE;
    s[0].rectangle.x1 = 10.0;
    s[0].rectangle.y1 = 10.0;
    s[0].rectangle.x2 = 20.0;
    s[0].rectangle.y2 = 50.0;
    /*
    *    A circle at (12.0, 40.0) with radius of 10.0 
    */
    s[1].type = A_CIRCLE;
    s[1].circle.x = 40.0;
    s[1].circle.y = 12.0;
    s[1].circle.radius = 10.0;
    /*
    *    A triangle at (20, 5), (20, 40), and (5, 20)
    */
    s[2].type = A_TRIANGLE;
    s[2].triangle.x1 = 5.0
    s[2].triangle.y1 = 20.0
    s[2].triangle.x2 = 40.0
    s[2].triangle.y2 = 20.0
    s[2].triangle.x3 = 20.0
    s[2].triangle.y3 = 5.0
    /*
    *    compute areas 
    */
    for( i = 0; i < 3; ++i )
         printf( "Area of shape[%d] = %f\n", i,
              compute_area( &s[i] ) );
    /*
    *    draw shapes
    */
    for( i = 0; i < 3; ++i )
         draw( &s[i] ) );
    return 0;
}
</PRE>
<P>The reason for going through this exercise is to point out the 
types of changes the programmer has to make when a new data type 
- a new object - has to be added to an existing program written 
in conventional procedure-oriented style.  Notice that the 
programmer has to edit working code - the switch statements in 
the <B>compute_area</B> and <B>draw</B> functions - when he/she wants to handle 
triangles in addition to the rectangles and circles that the 
program was originally designed to accept.  If this were a 
realistic program with many files, a change such as this would 
have required the programmer to edit switch statements in most of 
the files. 

<P>The object-oriented approach avoids this problem by keeping data 
structures together with functions that operate on them.  This 
approach effectively localizes the changes that become necessary 
when the programmer decides to add a new object to the program. 

<H3>9.20 OOP Terminology</H3>

<P>First the terminology of object-oriented programming needs to be defined.  The following terms are required knowledge when doing object-oriented programming.

<P><B>Data Abstraction:</B>  The process of defining a data type, often
called an abstract data type (ADT), together with the principle of 
data hiding.  The definition of an ADT involves specifying the 
internal representation of the ADT's data as well as the 
functions to be used by others to manipulate the ADT.  Data 
hiding ensures that the internal structure of the ADT can be 
altered without any fear of breaking the programs that call the 
functions provided for operations on the ADT.

<P><B>Method:</B>  A function by any other name.  A method is code bound to
an object.  The code provides an interface for messages 
requesting an operation and a means to perform the requested 
operation. 

<P><B>Object:</B>  A conceptual entity, implemented in software, which has
distinct boundaries and contains both data and code.  There are 
two types of code in an object - methods, which transfer data 
across the object's boundaries, and internal functions, which 
provide private services to the object.

<P><B>Class:</B>   A class is the template from which an object is derived.
It defines what data, functions and methods can be bound to the 
object.  An object is formed by creating an instance of the class 
and filling in the blanks.

<P><B>Inheritance:</B>  This is the ability to derive a new class from an
existing one.  The child class can be a sub or super set of the 
parent.  Multiple Inheritance is the ability to derive a new 
class from more than one parent class.

<P><B>Polymorphism:</B> Polymorphism is when two objects bind a different
method but access it by the same name.  The classic example is to 
create two classes, car and boat.  An object from either class can 
perform an operation "Move" but the method which carries out the 
operation is different.  The use of the same command to generate 
similar effects using different code is polymorphism.

<P><B>Information Hiding:</B>     Information hiding denies outside
entities direct access to the object's private data and 
functions.  Instead it forces outsiders to access the data in a 
controlled fashion via the object's methods.  As with some 
government agencies, if the programmer do not need to know, then 
knowing will gum the works. 

<P><B>Messaging:</B>    The act of communicating with an object to get
something done.  It consists of invoking a method, supplying 
that method with the information it requires, and receiving a 
reply from the method.  Clearly, messaging can be something as 
simple as a function call.
