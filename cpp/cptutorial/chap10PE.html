Chapter 10: Programming Exercises
</H1>
</A>
<PRE>
 1. Write a class called <B>CAccount</B> which contains two
    private data elements, an integer <B>accountNumber</B> 
    and a floating point <B>accountBalance</B>, and three 
    member functions:

         1. A constructor that allows the user to set 
            initial values for <B>accountNumber</B> and 
            <B>accountBalance</B> and a default constructor 
            that prompts for the input of the values for 
            the above data members.

         2. A function called <B>inputTransaction</B>, 
            which reads a  character value for 
            <B>transactionType</B> ('D' for deposit
            and 'W' for withdrawal), and a floating point 
            value for <B>transactionAmount</B>, which 
            updates <B>accountBalance</B>.

         3. A function called <B>printBalance</B>, which 
            prints on the screen the <B>accountNumber</B> 
            and <B>accountBalance</B>.
        
 2. Design a class <B>CCourse</B> that will hold the 
    courses that are offered at a local college.  The class 
    should at least have the following data members:
    
         year = the calendar year the class is being taught 
         term = the term the class is being taught in 
                (FALL, WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER)
         courseNumber = the course prefix and number 
                        (edp171, chm201, ... )
         sectionNumber = the three character value that  
                         identifies what specific section 
                         of the course is being taught
         building = what building the course is being 
                    taught in        
         room = what room the course is being taught in
         beginTime = what time the course starts (the 
                     beginning time can vary from one 
                     meeting to the next, 
                     i.e., The class meets at 1:00PM on 
                     Monday and Wednesday, but at 1:30PM on 
                     Tuesday and Thursday.)                      
         endTime = what time the course starts (the ending 
                   time can vary from one meeting to the 
                   next, i.e., The class ends at 3:00PM on 
                   Monday and Wednesday, but at 3:30PM on 
                   Tuesday and Thursday.)
         meetingDays = what days of the week the course 
                       meets, usually more than once a 
                       week.

    Develop all methods needed by the class.  You do not 
    have to  write a program to use the class.

 3. Design a class <B>CDocument</B> that will hold lines 
    that compose the contents of a document.  A document 
    can be text that comes from disk file or a list of 
    lines that are temporarily being held in memory.  The 
    class should have a 'has-a' relationship with a 
    <B>CDblList</B> class which is a double linked list 
    class.  The <B>CDocument</B> class should at least have 
    the following capabilities:

         1. A constructor that is passed the name of a disk 
            file.  The file will be opened, the contents 
            read and each line from the file will be stored 
            into an element of  the linked list.

         2. A default constructor that initializes the list 
            as  being empty.

         3. A copy constructor that initializes the list 
            from another instance of the <B>CDocument</B>.

         4. A group of browse functions for the list, such
            as:

              - insert a new item in the list
              - delete an item from the list
              - move to the beginning of the list
              - move to the end of the list
              - move to the next item in the list
              - move to the previous item in the list
              - are we at the beginning of the list
              - are we at the end of the list
              - return the value from the current item in 
                the list

         5. A method that returns a reference to the 
            current instance of the <B>CDocument</B> class.

    Develop all methods needed by the class.  You do not 
    have to write a program to use the class.        

 4. Design a class <B>CView</B> that will allow for the 
    display of  lines of text.  The class will paginate any 
    output, pausing at the end of each screen full shown 
    and allowing the input of the following commands:

              - N or n for move to next page
              - P or p for move to previous page
              - Q or q to quit the display and return to 
                the menu

    The <B>CView</B> class should at least have the 
    following capabilities:

         1. A constructor that is passed the address of a 
            <B>CDocument</B> class.  The <B>CDocument</B> 
            class manages the document that will be viewed.


         2. A default constructor that initializes the 
            display device to be blank.

    Develop all methods needed by the class.  You do not 
    have to write a program to use the class.
