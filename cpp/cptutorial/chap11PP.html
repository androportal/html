 1. You are to create an interactive program that will 
    present the following menu. 

    0: Quit
    1: Add an Event
    2: View Events

    An Event is a structure or class as follows:

    long julianDate;    // the date the event is scheduled 
                        // for
    long theTime;       // the time the event is scheduled 
                        // for
    char theEvent[256]; // the statement about the event

    This program will be written in C++ and you will create 
    the following C++ classes.  

    CMenu - stores a list of menu items; presents those 
            menu items on the screen; reads a selected menu 
            item and returns an integer value representing 
            the item selected.

    CDateTime - acquires the current date and time from the 
                system; keeps the date in gregorian and 
                julian formats; holds a string that 
                represents the current date, i.e. 
                "Monday, November 27, 1995"; holds the time 
                in hh:mm:ss format and in twenty-four hour 
                format.  Overload the following operators:

         + : adds a specified number of days to a julian
             date.
         - : substracts a specified number of days from a
             julian date.

    CDocument - opens a disk file and stores or retrieves 
                data from the file depending upon which 
                method of the class is called. The 
                constructor is passed the name of the file 
                to open, if the file does not exist then it 
                is created.  The file is assumed to always 
                be a binary data file.  This class holds 
                the data for the events.  Overload the 
                following operators:

         ++ : move to next item in document
         -- : move to previous item in document
         +  : add a new item to the document
         -  : delete an item from the document

    CView - displays data on the screen, one screen at a 
            time; supports the input of 'N' or 'n' for next 
            screen and 'P' or 'p' for previous screen; 
            also, 'q' or 'Q' for quit which returns back to 
            the main menu.

    In order for the program to obtain the current date and 
    time from the operating system.  The date and time can 
    be obtained by calling the <B>time()</B> and 
    <B>localtime()</B> functions. The following is a 
    sample program that obtains the date and time from the 
    system: 

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <time.h>

    main()
    {
    struct tm *ptr;
    int nseconds;

         nseconds = time( (time_t)NULL );
         ptr = localtime( &nseconds );
         printf("\nptr->tm_sec = %d",ptr->tm_sec);
         printf("\nptr->tm_min = %d",ptr->tm_min);
         printf("\nptr->tm_hour = %d",ptr->tm_hour);
         printf("\nptr->tm_mday = %d",ptr-tm_mday);
         printf("\nptr->tm_mon = %d",ptr->tm_mon);
         printf("\nptr->tm_year = %d",ptr->tm_year);
         printf("\nptr->tm_wday = %d",ptr->tm_wday);
         printf("\nptr->tm_yday = %d",ptr->tm_yday);
         printf("\nptr->tm_isdst = %d",ptr->tm_isdst);
         printf("\n");
    }

    The structure, <B>struct tm</B>, has the following 
    layout:

    struct tm
    {
         int tm_sec;    /* seconds after the minute ( 0 - 59 ) */
         int tm_min;    /* minutes after the hour ( 0 - 59 ) */
         int tm_hour;   /* hours since midnight ( 0 - 23 ) */
         int tm_mday;   /* day of the month ( 1 - 31 ) */
         int tm_mon;    /* month of the year ( 0 - 11 ) */
         int tm_year;   /* years since 1900 */
         int tm_wday;   /* days since Sunday ( 0 - 6 ) */
         int tm_yday;   /* day of the year ( 0 - 365 ) */
         int tm_isdst;  /* daylight savings time flag */ 
                        /* ( 1 = dst ) */
    };

 2. Write a program that maintains a list of contacts that 
    you have made at various businesses.  The program will 
    be menu driven and present the following menu:

    1. Add a contact
    2. Show contacts
    3. Quit application.

    The data held for each contact should be as follows: 

Field              Type         
-----------------------------
First Name         CString   
Last Name          CString   
Title              CString   
Company            CString   
Company Type       CString   
Address            CString   
Address2           CString   
City               CString   
State              CString   
Zip                CString   
Voice Phone        CString   
Fax Phone          CString   
Home Phone         CString   
Home Fax Phone     CString   
E-Mail Address     CString   
Last Contact       CDateTime

    The following classes need to be developed for the 
    application:


    CMenu - stores a list of menu items; presents those 
            menu items on the screen; reads a selected menu 
            item and returns an integer value representing 
            the item selected.

    CDateTime - acquires the current date and time from the 
                system; keeps the date in gregorian and 
                julian formats; holds a string that 
                represents the current date, i.e. 
                "Monday, November 27, 1995"; holds the time 
                in hh:mm:ss format and in twenty-four hour 
                format.  Has a constructor that is 
                initialized with the month, day, and year 
                for a specified date.  Overload the 
                following operators:

         + : adds a specified number of days to a julian
             date.
         - : substracts a specified number of days from a
             julian date.

    CDocument - opens a disk file and stores or retrieves 
                data from the file depending upon which 
                method of the class is called. The 
                constructor is passed the name of the file 
                to open, if the file does not exist then it 
                is created.  The file is assumed to always 
                be a binary data file.  This class 
                holds the data that is being managed.  
                Overload the following operators:

         ++ : move to next item in document
         -- : move to previous item in document
         +  : add a new item to the document
         -  : delete an item from the document

    CView - displays data on the screen, one screen at a 
            time;  supports the input of 'N' or 'n' for 
            next screen and 'P' or 'p' for previous screen; 
            also, 'q' or 'Q' for quit which returns back to 
            the main menu.
