<PRE>
 1. Write a C++ program that compares two text files and
    prints the lines where they first differ.  The program 
    reads one line each from two files until a differing 
    line is found or one of the files is exhausted, in 
    which case the line read from the other file is the 
    first differing line.  If both files are exhausted 
    simultaneously and no differing line has been found, 
    the two files are identical.  

    The program must take into account that two files may 
    be the same in the text, but only the number of spaces 
    or blanks on a line are different.  Therefore, each 
    line must be squeezed to eliminate blanks or spaces 
    before they are compared.  This method will give a true 
    comparison of two files.
