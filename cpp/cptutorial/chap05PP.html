 1. Let's suppose we want to print out a chart showing how 
    the time it takes to fly from one city to another 
    varies with the speed at which we fly.  The formula is 

         Distance = Speed * Time.  

    Let`s limit the speed to the range falling between 100 
    mph and 1000 mph, in increments of 100 mph, therefore 
    the formula you will use is 

         Time = Distance / Speed.

    You will write a program that will accept the name of 
    the city where the trip is to start, the name of the 
    destination city, the distance from the start city to 
    the destination city, the beginning speed to start the 
    calculation with, and the ending speed of the 
    calculations.  Your output will have the following 
    format: 

         Distance from <start city> to <destination city>
              is <miles>

         Rate(mph)      Time(hours)    
         ===========    =============  

    When the chart has been printed, ask if the user wishes 
    to continue, if so, then go back and ask for new input.  

 2. Write a program to output an ASCII chart like the one 
    below.  The program is to show a screen full of 
    information and then pause displaying 
    <B>More(Y/N)?</B>.  If the user wishes to see the next 
    screen, he/she presses Y, to terminate the program 
    press N.  The program must be sensitive to those 
    characters represented by decimal values 0-31.  These 
    are control characters and when sent to a terminal can 
    cause the terminal to lock up.  Therefore, the actual 
    character or the hexadecimal or the decimal value must 
    not be sent to the terminal, but only a string of 
    characters representing the image of the decimal, 
    hexadecimal and display character.

    DEC  HEX  CHAR      DEC  HEX  CHAR 
    0    00  ^@ NUL     64   40  @
    1    01  ^A SOH     65   41  A
    2    02  ^B STX     66   42  B
    3    03  ^C ETX     67   43  C
    4    04  ^D EOT     68   44  D
    5    05  ^E ENQ     69   45  E
    6    06  ^F ACK     70   46  F
    7    07  ^G BEL     71   47  G
    8    08  ^H BS      72   48  H
    9    09  ^I HT      73   49  I
    10   0A  ^J LF      74   4A  J
    ...

 3. Develop a program that will determine the gross pay for 
    each of several employees.  The company pays "straight-
    time" for the first 40 hours worked by each employee 
    and pays "time-and-a-half" for all hours worked in 
    excess of 40 hours.  You are to input a maximum of 6 
    employees.  Do not use if statements or a switch 
    statement, but use only loops.  The regular hours must 
    not exceed 40.  You must handle the input of employee 
    number, last name, first name, regular hours worked, 
    overtime worked, and pay rate.  After inputing all 
    values, then compute the net pay using 15% as the 
    deduction amount.  After all 6 employees are input, 
    then print totals for regular hours worked, overtime 
    hours worked, gross pay, total deductions and net pay.
