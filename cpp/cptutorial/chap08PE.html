Chapter 8: Programming Exercises

1. One very useful search algorithm for sorted lists is the
   binary search.  Write a program that will display the 
   following menu: 

    0. Quit
    1. Input Names
    2. Sort Names
    3. Search for Name

  The program will prompt for an input of a last name and 
  store the name into an array of pointers, <B>char 
  *theNames[20]</B>.  A maximum of twenty names will be 
  input or until the user indicates completion of input.
  The array can be sorted in ascending order using the 
  bubble sort algorithm.  A given name can be searched for 
  with the binary search algorithm. The algorithm is as 
  follows: 

  A.  Divide the sorted list into two halves.
  B.  Compare the element searched for with the midpoint 
      element.
  C.  If the midpoint element is equal to the searched 
      element, then we are finished.  If not, determine 
      which sublist the element should be in, top or 
      bottom.  This is the new list to search.
  D.  Repeat steps A through C until the element is found 
      or the searched list shrinks to zero, whichever 
      occurs first.

2. Write a program that prompts for the input of a text 
   string.  The program should loop accepting text strings 
   until the word 'end' is input as the only text on the 
   input line.  The lines input must be stored into an 
   array of pointers, <B>char *text[20];</B>, 
   no more than twenty lines to be input and allow the user 
   to quit input early.  Write a function <B>encrypt()</B> 
   that encrypts the text held in the array.  The 
   encryption algorithm will be your year of birth bitwise 
   exclusive or-ed with each character in the text 
   string.  Print the text strings before encryption and 
   after encryption. 

3. Write a program that will find, search and replace text 
   strings.  The program must prompt for the input of an 
   initial line of text.  The program will then prompt for 
   a phrase to be searched for and a phrase to replace the 
   found phrase with.  The replacement phrase can be 
   shorter or longer than the searched for phrase.  Show 
   the updated initial line of text on the display.
