 1. Write  a  program that allows the user to do a payroll
    listing on any number of employees, up to a maximum of 
    20, for a one week period.  This program must be 
    written using arrays and functions.  The program is to 
    be broken into various tasks, each task will be coded 
    as a function.  Each function will be passed 
    arguments and will return a value or values back from 
    the function.  Several arrays will be used in the 
    program, no array will exceed 20 elements.  One array 
    will hold the employee numbers that are input.  Other 
    arrays will hold the Computed Gross Pay, Computed 
    Federal Tax, Computed State Tax and Computed 
    Net Pay values.  When the user indicates he/she wishes 
    to stop the input of employee data, the program will 
    display a list of employee numbers, and the 
    corresponding computed values, plus a total for each of 
    the computed values. 
 
    The following shows a sample run of the program with 
    user inputs in <B>boldface</B>.

    Employee  Number  is  declared  as a variable and 
    assigned a value by the user as each employee's data is 
    processed. Character Data. 

    Regular Hours Worked is declared as a variable  and  is  
    input by the user as each employee's data is processed. 
    Integer Data. 

    Overtime  Hours  Worked  is  delcared  as a variable 
    and is input by the user as each employee's data is 
    processed. Integer Data. 

    Hourly Pay Rate is declared as a variable and  is  
    input  by the user as each employee's data is 
    processed. Float Data. 

    Marital Status is  declared as a variable and is input 
    by the user as each employee's data is processed.  Only 
    M or S may be input. 

    Exemptions is declared as a variable and is  input  by  
    the  user as  each  employee's  data  is  processed.   
    This is the number of tax exemptions  the  employee  is  
    taking.   In  this  program,  the  only allowable 
    values for exemptions is 0 thru 4. Integer Data. 

    Weekly  Gross Pay is a computed value derived from 
    Regular Hours Worked  multiplied  by  Hourly  Pay  Rate  
    plus  Overtime  Hours Worked multiplied by the product 
    of Hourly Pay Rate multiplied by 1.5. 

    Deductions  is  a  computed value to indicate the 
    amount of tax deductions, both federal and state, 
    needed to be subtracted  from  the Adjusted  Gross  
    Pay.   Adjusted  Gross  Pay is computed by 
    taking the number of Exemptions an employee has and 
    multiplying that  by  $13.50. This  amount  is  then  
    subtracted from the Weekly Gross Pay amount to give 
    Adjusted Gross Pay.  Adjusted Gross Pay is then used to 
    determine the amount of federal tax owed and the amount 
    of state tax owed.   The following indicates how to 
    calculate the federal and state tax amounts based on 
    the Adjusted Gross Pay. 

For Married Employees:

                                                 Of Amount
Adjusted Gross Pay  Federal       State          Over
------------------  ----------    -----------   ---------------
$0.00    - $100      10%           5%            $50.00
$101     - $300      $20.00 + 20%  $10.00 + 10%  $150.00
$301     - $600      $60.00 + 30%  $30.00 + 15%  $350.00
$601     - $9999     $180.00 + 50% $90.00 + 25%  $650.00

For Single Employees:

                                                 Of Amount
Adjusted Gross Pay  Federal       State          Over
------------------  ----------    -----------   ---------------
$0.00    - $100      10%           5%            $50.00
$101     - $300      $20.00 + 10%  $10.00 + 5%   $150.00
$301     - $600      $60.00 + 15%  $30.00 + 8%   $350.00
$601     - $9999     $180.00 + 25% $90.00 + 12%  $650.00

    Weekly Net Pay a computed amount showing  the  take  
    home  or net  pay  for the employee.  Weekly Net Pay is 
    computed by subtracting Deductions from Weekly Gross 
    Pay. 

    When all employee's payroll  data  has  been  
    processed,  display  the totals for gross pay, 
    deductions and net pay. 

    Each  numeric  value displayed on the screen should be 
    formatted using output formatting code.  After the user  
    enters  each  value,  rewrite it  to  the  screen  in  
    proper  format  so  that  all entries will be aligned 
    in columns. 

 2. You are given several functions, <B>calcday()</B>, 
    <B>leapyear()</B>, <B>julian()</B>, and 
    <B>gregorian()</B>.  Using these functions in 
    conjunction with functions that you will write, produce 
    a program that accepts as input a date in the form, 
    <B>MM-DD-YYYY</B>, where <B>MM</B> represents the month 
    of the year, <B>DD</B> represents the day within
    the month and <B>YYYY</B> represents the century and 
    year.

    After input of the date, display the date in textual 
    format and a calendar of the month the date falls 
    within.  Keep prompting for dates until the user inputs 
    a date of all zeros, 00-00-0000, then terminate the 
    program.  Make sure that all values input are valid.  

    In addition to your <B>main()</B> function, you will 
    write a <B>builddate()</B> function, a         
    <B>buildmonth()</B> function, and a            
    <B>show_date_month()</B> function.  This program will 
    require a two-dimensional array be used. 

    The following is an example run of the program with 
    user input in <B>boldface</B>.

    C:\>calendar
	   Enter a date(MM-DD-YYYY): <B>10-26-1990</B>

        Friday, October 26, 1990

        S  M  T  W  T  F  S
           1  2  3  4  5  6
        7  8  9  10 11 12 13
        14 15 16 17 18 19 20
        21 22 23 24 25 26 27
        28 29 30 31

	   Enter a date(MM-DD-YYYY): <B>00-00-0000</B>

        End of program.

 3. Write a program that will compute the quarter/semester 
    grades 
for all the students in a class.  This program will make use of 
functions and arrays.  

There is a maximum of forty students in any given class.  Each 
student has a maximum of twelve graded items.  Each student is 
given four tests, four programming assignments, and four homework 
assignments.  

The program must prompt for and read the course identifier, and 
section number, the student social security number, and then the 
scores the student made on each of the twelve items, these scores 
are a numerical value based upon a maximum score of 100.  Also, 
each of the items has a different weight in computing the grade.  
This weight is a percentile.  The sum of the three weights must 
not exceed 1.00.  The weights need only be input once for a 
class. 

To terminate the input of student data, input a blank social 
security number.

After all the students and their grades have been input, the 
program will then compute the numerical and letter grades for 
each student.  The grade is arrived at by the sumation of the 
scores of the items in each category, then computing the average 
score of each category.  Using the following formula the final 
numerical grade can be computed: 

    numerical_grade = weight_of_test * average_test_score
                    + weight_of_programs * average_program_score
                    + weight_of_homework * 
                      average_homework_score;

After the <B>numerical_grade<B> is computed then the letter grade is
determined from the following chart:

    100 - 93       A
    92  - 85       B
    84  - 77       C
    76  - 70       D
    69  - 0        F

Finally, the program will produce a report showing each student's 
social security number, test score average, programming score 
average, homework score average, numerical grade and letter 
grade.
