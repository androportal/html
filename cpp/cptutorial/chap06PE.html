Chapter 6: Programming Exercises
</H1>
</A>
<PRE>
 1. Write a program that consists of a <B>main()</B> 
    function and one or more other functions.  One of the 
    functions must be called <B>void printLetter( char, 
    short, char );</B> where the formal parameters are

    void printLetter( char symbol, short height, char letter );

    where 

    <B>symbol</B> is a character such as '*'; 
    <B>height</B> specifies the number of symbol characters 
         that compose the height; and, 
    <B>letter</B> specifies a letter of the alphabet.

    The <B>printLetter()</B> function prints a letter with 
    the height specified using the specified symbol.  For 
    example,

    symbol = '*'
    height = '5'
    letter = 'c'

    the function will print

		    *******
		    *
		    *
		    *
		    *******

    The width will always be 7.  Make the program 
    continuously prompt for the input of the above data 
    until a -1 is input for the height.  This should be 
    written using C++ syntax.

 2. Write a program that will convert an unsigned integer 
    number to its binary representation and print on the 
    screen that binary representation.  This program should 
    consist of a <B>main()</B> function, which prompts for 
    the input of an unsigned integer value from the 
    keyboard, and a second function called 
    <B>convertToBinary( char [], unsigned )</B>, which 
    converts the unsigned argument passed to its binary 
    form.  The character string holding the binary string 
    is returned in an array that is passed as an argument.  
    DO NOT assume the word length of the system, but 
    determine the word length by obtaining the number of 
    bytes in an integer and using 8-bits as representing a 
    byte.  Declare the array for the storage of the binary 
    image large enough to hold 32 bits.  Write the program 
    using C++ syntax.

 3. Write a program to encode a message using the following
    techique.

    1.   Enter a message (allow up to 256 characters).
    2.   Use a function compress() to remove the spaces 
         from the entered message.
    3.   Print out the ASCII codes for the message 
         characters in groups of 10 separated by two 
         spaces.
