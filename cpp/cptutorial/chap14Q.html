<PRE>
 T  F    1. Preprocessing directives are evaluated before 
            language keywords.

 T  F    2. One macro cannot be used to help define 
            another.

 T  F    3. Every macro parameter occurrence in the macro 
            body should be surrounded by parenthesis.

 T  F    4. The backslash is needed to continue the 
            definition of a macro to another line.

 T  F    5. It is required that defined constant names be 
            in uppercase.
                    
 T  F    6. The <B>#</B> operator creates a character 
            pointer whose name is that of the macro 
            argument.

 T  F    7. Arithmetic expressions in a macro should be 
            surrounded by parentheses, even if that means 
            enclosing the entire macro body.

 T  F    8. The <B>#define</B> directive is used to create 
            both simple replacement and function-like 
            macros.

 T  F    9. The <B>#line</B> directive allows for the 
            setting of the <B>__DATE__</B> and 
            <B>__TIME__</B> macros.

 T  F   10. The <B>#error</B> directive allows for the 
            output of a message to stdout when a runtime 
            error is  encountered.

 T  F   11. The preprocessor has been a part of C from 
            the inception of the language.

 T  F   12. Preprocessing directives are evaluated before C 
            language keywords like <B>while</B>, 
            <B>for</B>, or <B>if</B>.

 T  F   13. It is appropriate to think of the preprocessor 
            as a smart text editor.

 T  F   14. One macro cannot be used to help define 
            another.

 T  F   15. The <B>#define</B> directive is used to create 
            both simple replacement and function-like 
            macros.

 T  F   16. Macro parameters have data types, just like 
            function parameters.

 T  F   17. Every macro parameter occurrence in the macro 
            body should be surrounded by parentheses.

 T  F   18. The backslash is needed to continue the 
            definition of a macro to another line.

 T  F   19. It is required that macro names be in 
            uppercase.

 T  F   20. Without <B>#undef</B> it is impossible to 
            redefine a macro.

 T  F   21. The <B>#if defined</B> directive requires that 
            the identifier being examined not only be 
            defined, but also have at least a space for a 
            value.

 T  F   22. The <B>#if</B> and related directives can be 
            nested.

 T  F   23. The <B>#</B> operator creates a character 
            pointer whose name is that of the macro 
            argument.

 T  F   24. The concatenation operator can be used to 
            dynamically build both macro and variable 
            names.

 T  F   25. The preprocessor helps you debug your C cyntax.


 T  F   26. All macros must be defined in your program.

 T  F   27. Conditional compilation can help you move your 
            program to new environments while retaining one 
            set of base code.

 T  F   28. Assigning a macro name to string literals make 
            changing your program easier.

 T  F   29. If a compiler already has a macro called 
            <B>min</B>, we would have problems creating a 
            <B>MIN</B> macro to be used together with 
            <B>min</B>.

 T  F   30. Arithmetic expressions in a macro should be 
            surrounded by parentheses, even if that means 
            enclosing the entire macro body.

31. A macro, compared to its equivalent function 
    implementation, is generally:

    a.   More complicated
    b.   Faster in execution speed.
    c.   Coded from a different algorithm.
    d.   None of the above.
    e.   All of the above.

32. What is wrong with the following macro?

    #define   TRUE      1
    #define   FALSE     0
    #define   TEST(bin,bit)  bin & bit ? TRUE : FALSE

    (Assume that <B>bin</B> is a binary number and 
     <B>bit</B> is the bit to be tested.)

    a.   The type <B>bin</B> is not valie in C.
    b.   The macro will always return TRUE.
    c.   Side effects may arise in the expansion.
    d.   TRUE and FALSE will not be expaned to TEST.

33. One use for the <B>#ifdef</B> proprocessor directive 
    could be:

    a.   Building applications that can be used in 
         different operating system environments.
    b.   Nesting one function within another.
    c.   Dynamic memory allocation within a macro.
    d.   None of the above.

34. What is wrong with the code fragment given below?

    #define SQUARE(x)   ((x) * (x))
         ...
    /* produce a table of squares from 1 to 10 */
    int i = 0;

    while( i <= 10 )
         printf("%d squared = %d\n", SQUARE(++i) );
         ...

    a.   The loop will not terminate because <B>++i</B> 
         will not be evaluated in the macro expansion.
    b.   The macro expansion will introduce side effects, 
         resulting in an incorrect table of squares.
    c.   The increment operator cannot be used in a macro.
    d.   The macro argument <B>x</B> cannot be used more 
         than once in the macro definition.  A compile 
         error will be the result.

35. Which statement is not true when applied to the 
    <B>#if</B> family of preprocessor directives?

    a.   They can be nested.
    b.   They can be used as functionally equivalent to the 
         C construct <B>if/else</B>.
    c.   They are always evaluated before compilation takes 
         place.
    d.   The <B>#else</B>, if present, is always associated 
         with the closest preceding <B>#if</B> directive.

36. The predefined macros <B>__DATE__</B> and 
    <B>__TIME__</B> are useful because

    a.   They can be used to reset the system date and/or 
         time.
    b.   They are difficult (impossible?) to retrieve by 
         other methods.
    c.   They can be used to dynamically retrieve the 
         current date/time at runtime.
    d.   None of the above.

37. What is wrong with the following code fragment?

    #define IBM
    #if defined(IBM)
    #     define   MAX_INT   16
    #elif defined(MACINTOSH)
    #     define MAX_INT     32
    #else defined(ATARI800)
    #     define MAX_INT     8
    ...
    printf("Maximum integer is %d\n", MAX_INT );

    a.   There is no <B>#endif</B> directive.
    b.   <B>IBM</B> has no value.
    c.   The <B>define</B> directives cannot be indented.
    d.   <B>MAX_INT</B> would be undefined, which would 
         produce a compile error.
    e.   All of the above.
    f.   None of the above.
