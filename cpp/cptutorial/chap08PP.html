1. Write a structure, <B>struct card</B>, that will 
   represent a card in a standard deck of playing cards.  
   You will need to represent both the suit (clubs, 
   diamonds, hearts, or spades) as well as the 
   rank (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2) of each 
   card.  Note that a deck of playing cards can be 
   represented as an array declared as 

    struct card deck[52];

   Using the above structure write a program that will 
   present a menu with the following options:

    1.   Deal Five Cards
    2.   Deal Seven Cards
    3.   Quit the Game

    Enter Selection:

   If the user selects either of the deal options, the 
   program will call a function that performs a perfect 
   shuffle of the deck.  In a perfect shuffle, the deck is 
   broken exactly in half and rearranged so that the first 
   card is followed by the 27th card, followed by the 
   second card, followed by the 28th card, and so 
   on.  The program then asks for how many players are at 
   the table.  There can be no more than seven players at 
   the table and no less than three players.  The program 
   will then deal cards, either five cards per player or 
   seven cards per player depending upon the menu 
   selection, to the players at the table.  The dealer, the 
   program, always is dealt to last.  Using a simple 
   scoring method of where A=11, K=Q=J=10, and all other 
   cards are of face value, compute and display which hand 
   holds the most points. 

2. You have been hired to help program a new "Ma Bell" 
   telephone feature. The feature allows users with a "PC" 
   to obtain a disk of telephone numbers in addition to a 
   telephone book. Your job is to write the program which 
   will allow the phone information to be used. 

   You must allow the addition of and viewing of phone 
   number information. 

   The program should be able to:

    1. Add people to the telephone list
    2. View all people in the list
    3. View based on just the last name

   You may make the following assumptions:

    1. There are no more than 100 phone numbers
    2. No name is longer than 50 characters.
    3. Only one telephone number per person.
    4. The address should be broken into only
         street # or po box
         street name
         zip code 

3. Write a program that uses C++ syntax and that creates an 
   index for lines of text.  The program must prompt for a 
   topic, no more than twenty characters and blanks are 
   allowed.  The topic will be passed through a hashing 
   algorithm.  The hashing algorithm will add together the 
   ASCII values of the characters composing the topic.  The 
   resultant number will be used in a modulo division where 
   the divisor will be fifty (50), the maximum number of 
   topics allowed.  The result of the modulo division, 
   which is the remainder will be used as the index into 
   the topic index array, which has 50 elements.  Each 
   topic is used to compute its location within the topic 
   index array.  The program will then prompt for the input 
   of a text string.  The text string will be read into a 
   character array, <B>kbdBuffer</B>, that is setup for a
   maximum of 256 characters.  The program will use 
   <B>new</B> in conjunction with <B>strlen</B> to allocate 
   space from the heap that will hold the number of 
   characters being held in <B>kbdBuffer</B>.  The data
   will be transferred from <B>kbdBuffer</B> to the 
   allocated space.  The address of the allocated space 
   will be stored into an array of pointers to character 
   type data, which holds 50 pointers.  The index computed 
   from the topic string will also be used to determine the 
   array index where the address of the allocated space 
   will be stored.  A maximum of fifty topics and 
   associated text strings can be input.  The user can 
   terminate the input of topics early if desired.  After 
   the termination of topic input, show the contents of the 
   topic array and the associated text string.  Only show 
   one screen full at a time.  The letter 'n' or 'N' can be 
   used to proceed to the next page of topics and strings.  
   The input of the letter 'q' or 'Q' will quit the 
   program.
