1. You are to write a program that will calculate your electric bill. You are to input the number of kilo-watt hours (kwh) used in a 31 day billing period.

Electricity costs 6.72 cents per kwh, a state tax of
8% is added as is a city tax of 3.5%.

Write a program that accepts the number of hours used,
along with your first name, last name, social security number, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone area code and telephone number.

The program is to print a display with the following
layout:


 Electric Bill for<last name>,<first name>
<social security number>

 Address:<street>
         <city>, <state> <zip code>
 Phone : (<AREA code>)<phone number>

 Amount of electric bill for<number of days> days
 at<rate per kwh> is         :<amt1>

 State Tax(<state tax rate>) :<amt2>

 City Tax (city tax rate>)   :<amt3>

                              --------

 Total                       :<total>

2. Write a program that will input an integer and output the minimum number of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies
needed to make up the input amount. Two sample runs follow
with user input in <B>boldface</B>.
