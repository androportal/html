 T  F    1.   A pointer contains the address of the object
              to which it points.

 T  F    2.   The <B>*</B> character, when defining a 
              declaring a pointer, is read "pointer to".

 T  F    3.   Any pointer can point at anything; the type 
              specifier is merely used for documentation.

 T  F    4.   If <B>msg</B> is a character pointer, then
              <B>msg = "A Literal"</B>; will copy the 
              string literal <B>"A Literal"</B> into the 
              area pointed to by <B>msg</B>.

 T  F    5.  All arithmetic done with pointers is scaled to 
             the size of the object being pointed to.

 T  F    6.  If a pointer variable is used as an actual 
             argument when calling a function, then the 
             compiler passes the address of where the 
             pointer is located, not a copy of the pointer 
             itself.

 T  F    7.  If two <B>*</B> characters are used when 
             defining a variable, it is a pointer to 
             another pointer.

 T  F    8.  The variable names <B>argc</B> and <B>argv</B> 
             are reserved and can only be used with the 
             <B>main()function</B>.

 T  F    9.  The type of the expression <B>(*++argv)[0]</B> 
             is character.

 T  F    10. Code that subscripts a pointer outside the 
             defined boundaries of the array may compile, 
             but logically be in error.

 T  F    11. The definition <B>(*what_is_this())()</B> is 
             that of a function returning a pointer to an 
             array of integers.

12. Which pair of the following statements are equivalent?

    a.   *value[1];
         *(value + 1);
    b.   **value;
         *value;
    c.   *value[2];
         (*value++)++;
    d.   *value;
         &value;

13. What is wrong with the following code fragment?

    char code[] = "This is a secret message...";

    main()
    {
    int checksum = 0;

         while ( *code )
         {
              checksum += *code;
              ++code;
         }
    }

    a.   The array name "code" cannot be incremented.
    b.   Characters cannot be added.
    c.   The <B>*</B> operator cannot be used with a 
         character array name.
    d.   The loop will not terminate since a logical FALSE 
         will never occur.

14. A null pointer can be described as:

    a.   The same as <B>void *</B>.
    b.   A "special" pointer that is typically used to flag 
         an error or a termination indicator for arrays.
    c.   A pointer that points to a binary zero in memory.
    d.   Exactly the same as a logical FALSE value.
 
15. A good application for using an array of pointers is 
    when:

    a.   The objects pointed to are different data types.
    b.   One of the objects must be passed to a function.
    c.   The design indicates indirect addressing of the 
         objects pointed to.
    d.   The objects are integers, which are always the 
         same as pointers.

16. When the variable <B>argv</B> is passed to 
    <B>main()</B> it references:

    a.   A string array.
    b.   An array of pointers to the command line arguments 
         (strings).
    c.   Characters passed from the command line.
    d.   All command line arguments beginning with the 
         character "-".
