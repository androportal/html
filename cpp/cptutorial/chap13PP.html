 1. Write a line oriented text editor program in C++ that 
    accepts the input of the file to be edited on the 
    command line.  If the file name is not input on the 
    command line, the program indicates that the file does 
    not exist and terminates.  If the file is present, 
    the contents of the file are read into memory and 
    placed into a list for further processing.

    A line editor is represented by a doubly linked list of 
    nodes, each of which contains a pointer to the text of 
    the line.  In addition, each node contains the number 
    of bytes in the text line.  There is one external 
    pointer to this list, which points to the "current" 
    line position in the text being edited.  The 
    list has a header node, which contains the string: 

    '----Top of File----'

    and a trailer node, which contains the string:

    '----Bottom of File----'

    Write a line editor that only supports the listing of 
    lines of text to the screen.  The program will execute 
    and display the first line of text in the file along 
    with the line number of that line.  The program will 
    then show its prompt, a '<B>?</B>', and is ready to 
    accept commands.  For example:

    ----Top of File----
    1: main()
?

    If a list or print of lines goes to the end of the 
    file, the trailer node holding 

    '<B>----Bottom of File----</B>' 

    must be displayed as the last line.

    Each node of the linked list holds a <B>CTextLine</B> 
    class item.  A <B>CTextLine</B> is a class that is 
    derived from <B>CRecord</B> which is an abstract base 
    class that generically defines records that are 
    held within a document.  The <B>CTextLine</B> class has 
    the following data members.  

    char *textLine;    // the text of a line from the file
    size_t textLgth;   // the length of the line being held

    The abstract base class <B>CRecord</B> defines two pure 
    virtual functions for reading input from the disk and 
    for placing data onto the disk. 

    <B>virtual void readRecord( size_t length) const = 0;</B>
    <B>virtual void writeRecord( size_t length) const = 0;</B>

    The <B>CTextLine</B> class implements its own versions 
    of these functions in order to read and write data to 
    disk. 

    This program will create the following C++ classes.  

    CDocument - opens a disk file and stores or retrieves 
                data from the file depending upon which 
                method of the class is called. The 
                constructor is passed two arguments:

                - the name of the file to open, if the file 
                  does not exist a boolean is set                   indicating such.
 
        	    - the address of a <B>CRecord</B> class or 
                  derived class.

                This class has a pointer to the 
                <B>CRecord</B> class which holds the
                address passed as a parameter of the 
                constructor.  Overload the following 
                operators:

         ++ : move to next item in document
         -- : move to previous item in document
         +  : add a new item to the document
         -  : delete an item from the document

               Use the pointer to the <B>CRecord</B> type 
               to access the correct derived class that 
               knows how to read and write data of the 
               correct type to and from the disk.

    CView - displays data on the screen, one screen at a 
            time

    CCommandSet - this class holds the commands allowed and 
                  maps those keys to methods within this 
                  class.  The initial command set will be 
                  as follows:
                 (<B><CR></B> means that the RETURN key is 
                      pressed)

                  <CR>      show next line in file
                            m,np<CR>  show the lines of 
                            text starting with line number 
                            <B>m</B> and ending with line 
                            number '<B>n</B>'

                  n<CR>     show the text for line number 
                            '<B>n</B>'

                  np<CR>    show the next '<B>n</B>' lines 
                            of text in the file
   
            w filename<CR>  write the contents of the 
                            linked list to the 
         			    '<B>filename</B>' specified.

                  q<CR>     quit the editor

 2. Develop the following classes:

         CDataBase - a data base class that opens a data 
                     file and an index file.  This class 
                     supports a 'has-a' relationship with 
                     <B>CRecord</B> and <B>CIndex</B>.  
                     This class will support methods for:

              - define the location of a key in each record
                as being a specified number of bytes from
                the beginning of the record and being a 
                stated number of bytes in length.

              - receiving an address of <B>CRecord</B> type 
                object and placing the data held in the 
                object on the data file through polymorphic 
                behavior

              - retrieving data from the data file by using 
                an address of a <B>CRecord</B> type object 
                that reads the data file.
                
              - has an instance of <B>CIndex</B> type data 
                that is used to maintain a sorted list of 
                keys into the data file.

         CRecord - an abstract base class that defines 
                   generic behavior for a record that is to 
                   be written to or read from the data file 
                   of the data base.

         CIndex - a class that keeps a sorted array of keys 
                  into the data file.  A key is a structure 
                  that has a the following format:

              struct Key
              {
                   char *keyValue;     // holds the value that is
                                       // used as a key to access
                                       // the associated data 
                                       // record; keys are always
                                       // characters
                   long dataOffset;    // the number of bytes
                                       // from the beginning of
                                       // the data file where the
                                       // associated record is 
                                       // stored
              };

                The index is saved into an index file when 
                the data base is closed.

    Also, develop a test program that will save student 
    information, <B>CStudent</B>, into the data base, using 
    student social security number as the key.     
    <B>CStudent</B> will be a derived class from 
    <B>CRecord</B>.  Make the program present a
    menu, <B>CMenu</B>, that has the following items.


         1. Add students
         2. View students
         3. Quit application

    The program must acquire student data interactively 
    from the keyboard and store that data into the data 
    base.  When processing a request to view the data, the 
    data will be show in the ascending order of the key 
    field, student social security number.

    <B>CStudent</B> has the following data members.

         Social Security Number
         Last Name
         First Name
         Street
         City
         State
         Zip
         Area Code
         Phone
         Major
