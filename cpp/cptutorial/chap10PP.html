            account balance.

         4. Do the above operations as long as the user 
            wants to continue.

                the menu
                
 3. Develop a program that uses the <B>CCourse</B>,

            the list into year, term, courseNumber and 
            sectionNumber order.  

         4. When viewing the list of courses, pause at each 
            page and allow the user to input any of the 
            following commands:

              - N or n for move to next page
